Analyzing financial records of a company

## Overview
 
In this challenge I am tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company.

## Instructions

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * I will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
